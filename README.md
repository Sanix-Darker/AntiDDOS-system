## How it work?
<img src="img/icon.png" >
At each connection, the system temporarily saves the ip address of the client and monitors its connection frequency, if this connection frequency is abnormal, then the system considers it as a black ip address and sends a verification request in the form of a verification. Captcha integrated into the system, if he passes this check, then it is a human and not a robot!
